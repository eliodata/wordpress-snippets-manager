# IDE Code Snippets Bridge

*Bridge your WordPress development with AI-powered snippet management*

This WordPress plugin serves as the essential bridge between your WordPress site and IDE extensions (like [Trae AI](https://github.com/trae-ai/wordpress-snippets-manager) or VS Code extensions), enabling seamless code snippet management with cutting-edge AI assistance.

## 🚀 What are compatible IDEs?

This plugin works with various IDE extensions that bring artificial intelligence directly to your WordPress development workflow. For example, Trae AI supports multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) and allows you to:

- **Edit snippets with natural language**: Simply describe what you want to change
- **Create complex functionality**: From simple design tweaks to advanced logic
- **Manage snippets effortlessly**: List, view, edit, and organize all your snippets
- **Sync in real-time**: Changes are instantly reflected on your WordPress site
- **Automatic backups**: Every modification is safely backed up with easy restoration

## 🔧 How It Works

This plugin creates a secure REST API that allows compatible IDE extensions to:

1. **Retrieve** all your existing code snippets
2. **Create** new snippets directly from your IDE
3. **Update** snippet content with AI-powered modifications
4. **Delete** snippets you no longer need
5. **Toggle** snippet activation status

## 📋 Requirements

- **WordPress**: 5.0 or higher
- **PHP**: 7.4 or higher
- **Snippet Management Plugin**: Either Code Snippets or FluentSnippets plugin
- **Administrator Access**: Required for API authentication
