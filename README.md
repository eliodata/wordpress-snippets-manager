### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The system consists of two parts:
1.  **The IDE Extension**: An intelligent agent that runs in VS Code or Trae AI. It interprets your requests, interacts with the AI models, and manages your local snippet files.
2.  **The Companion WordPress Plugin**: A lightweight plugin that creates a secure REST API on your WordPress site. This allows the extension to safely communicate with your snippet database.

### üîå Supported WordPress Snippet Plugins

This extension supports multiple WordPress snippet management plugins:

*   **Code Snippets**: The most popular WordPress snippet plugin with over 1 million active installations.
*   **FluentSnippets**: Advanced snippet management with enhanced organization features.

**Seamless Switching**: Use the plugin switcher button in the extension toolbar to switch between different snippet providers without restarting VS Code.

**Smart ID System**: 
- Code Snippets use numeric IDs (e.g., search "15" to find snippet #15)
- FluentSnippets use prefixed IDs (e.g., search "FS3" or just "3" to find FluentSnippet #3)
- The extension automatically handles ID conflicts and provides intelligent search across both systems

### üåê Multi-Site Management

**NEW**: Manage multiple WordPress sites from a single interface!

*   **Multiple Connections**: Configure and store connections to different WordPress sites
*   **Quick Switching**: Switch between sites instantly with a single click
*   **Custom Names**: Give meaningful names to your connections ("Production", "Staging", "Client Site")
